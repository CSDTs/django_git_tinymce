Back-end:
  - ~~Modify tag and sub-tag of repo (ModelForm)~~
  - Indication of owner in render mode/page
  - Editable template
  - Parse commit message
  - Show only file changed in commit view
  - ~~Fix create file form - wrong editor~~
  - Template nav image absolut url
  - ~~Prefill rename file form~~
  - file rename should slug/protect (don't allow ' or " etc..)
  - Random folder go to broken
  - Base folder xxxx while in folder 
  - ~~Move submit button down in repo settings page~~
  - remove gitusers model
  - Subfoder view, base folder link in CAP letters
  - ~~Configure CKEditor to allow script tag~~


Front-end:
  - ~~Default image~~
  - Tag filter (grade level, subject). (API is done.)
  - Loading indication while forking
  - Admin link vs. index render link
  - Remove branch button
  - Folder drop info/handle
  - Auto complete user
  - Readme not embedded
  - Download image corrupt (suspect extention in CAP letters) - file: layout.js(256:165)
    - This can be handled by backend, easier.


Both:
  - Delete folders
  - Hide .placeholder
  - Warn overwrite drag and drop upload
  - Static link change


Enhancement:
  - Limit tags / auto-complete
